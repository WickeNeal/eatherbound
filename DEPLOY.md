# How to Publish to GitHub Pages

Your code is already on GitHub! To make it live as a website:

1.  Go to your repository settings: [https://github.com/WickeNeal/eatherbound/settings](https://github.com/WickeNeal/eatherbound/settings)
2.  On the left sidebar, click **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
3.  Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, keep it as "Deploy from a branch".
4.  Under **Branch**, click the dropdown (currently "None") and select **main**.
5.  Ensure the folder is set to **/(root)**.
6.  Click **Save**.

Wait about 1-2 minutes. Refresh the page, and you will see a banner at the top saying:
> "Your site is live at..."

Click that link to see your landing page online!
