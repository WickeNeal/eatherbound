# Week 3: Procedural Generation Overview

**Goal:** Infinite dungeons that look handcrafted.
**Concept:** "Deterministic generation".
If I tell you "Draw a map with seed 123", you draw a map.
If I tell your friend "Draw a map with seed 123", they draw the EXACT SAME map.
This saves bandwidth. We don't send the map. We send the *seed*.

## The Schedule
- **Day 11:** Deterministic RNG (The `RandomNumberGenerator` class).
- **Day 12:** BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) - The standard for Rogue-like rooms.
- **Day 13:** AutoTiling (Making it look like a cave, not squares).
- **Day 14:** Network Recreation (Sending the seed).
- **Day 15:** Cleanup.

**Proceed to Day 11.**
