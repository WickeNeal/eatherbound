# Week 4: Souls-like Combat Overview

**Goal:** "Weighty" combat.
**Concept:** You don't just click and deal damage. You commit.
- **Commitment:** Once you press "Attack", you cannot move until the animation ends.
- **Precision:** The hitbox is only active during the "swing", not the "windup" or "recovery".

## The Schedule
- **Day 16:** Collision Layers (Review & Refine).
- **Day 17:** Animation Events (The Call Method Track).
- **Day 18:** Poise & Stagger (The Stun mechanic).
- **Day 19:** Enemy AI (Behavior Trees).
- **Day 20:** Juice (Screenshake).

**Proceed to Day 16.**
